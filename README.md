# CROWD-MANAGEMENT-OF-ROUTES - Traffic Volume Prediction App 
using app feature this we can predicct the crowd management and say the user to divert the route
Overview
The Crowd Management of Routes app is designed to predict whether a metro route is "Crowded" or "Not Crowded" based on traffic volume data. The app uses machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict traffic volume based on specific time features, such as the hour, day, month, and day of the week. It also provides a graphical representation of traffic volume distribution.

Objective
Predict traffic volume using a trained Random Forest model.
Classify routes as "Crowded" or "Not Crowded" based on the predicted traffic volume.
Allow users to input specific date and time details to get real-time predictions.
Key Features
Dataset Upload: Users can upload the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset (Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv).
Interactive Prediction: Users can input hour, day, month, and day of the week to predict traffic volume and determine crowd status.
Traffic Volume Visualization: The app generates a distribution plot of traffic volume to help users understand how traffic behaves over time.
How the App Works
1. Load Dataset
Once you launch the app, you will be prompted to upload the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset in CSV format. The dataset should include at least the following columns:

date_time: The timestamp of the traffic volume data.
traffic_volume: The actual traffic volume at that time.
2. Train the Model
The app processes the dataset, extracting key features such as:

Hour: The hour of the day.
Day: The day of the month.
Month: The month of the year.
Day of the Week: The day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday).
These features are used to train a Random Forest Regressor model that predicts the traffic volume based on historical data. The model is trained when the dataset is uploaded, and you can use the model for predictions immediately.

3. Make a Prediction
You can input specific time values (hour, day, month, and day of the week) into the app. When you click "Predict", the app will use the trained model to predict the traffic volume for the given time.

Inputs for Prediction:
Hour: An integer between 0 and 23.
Day: An integer between 1 and 31.
Month: An integer between 1 and 12.
Day of the Week: An integer between 0 (Monday) and 6 (Sunday).
Crowd Classification:
Based on a threshold of 100 traffic volume units, the app classifies the route as either "Crowded" or "Not Crowded". If the predicted traffic volume is greater than or equal to 100, the route is classified as "Crowded".
4. Visualization
In addition to the prediction, the app also generates a histogram of traffic volume from the uploaded dataset. This helps users visually understand the distribution of traffic volume over time.

App Components
1. User Interface
File Uploader: Upload the CSV file of the traffic dataset.
Prediction Inputs: Text boxes for hour, day, month, and day of the week.
Predict Button: A button to trigger the prediction based on user inputs.
Results Display: Shows the predicted traffic volume and crowd status ("Crowded" or "Not Crowded").
Plot: A traffic volume distribution graph for visualization.
2. Backend
Data Preprocessing: Date and time information is extracted from the date_time column of the dataset.
Model Training: The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the processed features.
Prediction: The model predicts traffic volume based on user inputs.
Crowd Classification: Predicted traffic volume is compared with a threshold (default: 100) to determine whether the route is "Crowded" or "Not Crowded".
Usage Instructions
Running the Application
Install Required Libraries: Ensure that you have installed the following libraries using pip
upload the Dataset: After launching, the app will open in your browser. Upload the dataset by clicking the "Browse files" button.

Enter Prediction Inputs: After the dataset is processed, enter the hour, day, month, and day of the week into the input fields.

Predict and Visualize: Click the Predict button to view the traffic volume and crowd status. A traffic volume distribution graph will also be displayed.


Model Details
Random Forest Regressor:
The app uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict traffic volume. Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

Scaling:
The input features are scaled using a StandardScaler to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps improve model performance.

Conclusion
This app provides an interactive way to predict traffic volume and classify whether a route is "Crowded" or "Not Crowded" based on user-provided time inputs. It also visualizes the traffic volume distribution from the uploaded dataset, allowing users to gain insights into traffic patterns.
